# Week 07

This week we're going to learn about API's using Netlify and the Steam Web API

1. Clone this repository to your own computer: https://github.com/tylermuir42/steamProject

2. Look through the code of this project. See if you can figure out what lines of code are connecting to the steam web api.

3. Follow the directions in NETLIFY-DEPLOY.md

This app is a work in progress so the functionality is minimal but it should help you get the idea of how api's work.
